Matplotlib: 
  • Introduction: 
    Matplotlib is the foundation of Python visualization. It mimics MATLAB-style 
    plotting and provides the most control over figure elements. It is a low-level 
    library, meaning users must explicitly define details like axis labels, colors, and 
    markers, which offers maximum flexibility at the cost of verbosity. 
  • Unique Features: 
    o Can create virtually any 2D visualization (and limited 3D plots via 
    mpl_toolkits). 
    o Integrates with NumPy arrays and Pandas DataFrames. 
    o Allows exporting figures in multiple formats (PNG, PDF, SVG). 
    o Supports animations and interactive visualizations in Jupyter notebooks. 
    • Typical Use Cases: 
    o Academic research papers needing precise control. 
    o Data scientists wanting publication-ready plots. 
    o Developers needing custom visualizations integrated into applications.
